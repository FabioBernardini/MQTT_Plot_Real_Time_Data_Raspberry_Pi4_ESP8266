# MQTT_Plot_Real_Time_Data_Raspberry_Pi4_ESP8266-
In this repository, the code for implementing a MQTT communication between an ESP8266 and a Raspberry Pi 4 is represented. In particular, the ESP8266 sends temperature and humidity values coming from a DHT11 sensor. The values are sent to a broker MQTT and then visualized in real-time with Raspberry Pi 4
